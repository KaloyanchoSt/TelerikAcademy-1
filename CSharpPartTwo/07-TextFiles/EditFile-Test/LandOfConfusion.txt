0. 0. I must have dreamed a thousand dreams
1. 1. Been haunted by a million screams
2. 2. But I can hear the marching feet
3. 3. They're moving into the street
4. 4. 
5. 5. Now, did you read the news today?
6. 6. They say the danger has gone away
7. 7. But I can see the fire's still alight
8. 8. They're burning into the night
9. 9. 
10. 10. There's too many men, too many people
11. 11. Making too many problems
12. 12. And there's not much love to go around
13. 13. Can't you see this is a land of confusion?
14. 14. 
15. 15. This is the world we live in
16. 16. And these are the hands we're given
17. 17. Use them and let's start trying
18. 18. To make it a place worth living in
19. 19. 
20. 20. Oh, superman, where are you now?
21. 21. When everything's gone wrong somehow?
22. 22. The men of steel, these men of power
23. 23. Are losing control by the hour
24. 24. 
25. 25. This is the time, this is the place
26. 26. So we look for the future
27. 27. But there's not much love to go around
28. 28. Tell me why this is a land of confusion
29. 29. 
30. 30. This is the world we live in
31. 31. And these are the hands we're given
32. 32. Use them and let's start trying
33. 33. To make it a place worth living in
34. 34. 
35. 35. I remember long ago
36. 36. When the sun was shining
37. 37. And all the stars were bright all through the night
38. 38. In the wake of this madness, as I held you tight
39. 39. So long ago
40. 40. 
41. 41. I won't be coming home tonight
42. 42. My generation will put it right
43. 43. We're not just making promises
44. 44. That we know we'll never keep
45. 45. 
46. 46. There's too many men, too many people
47. 47. Making too many problems
48. 48. And there's not much love to go round
49. 49. Can't you see this is a land of confusion?
50. 50. 
51. 51. Now, this is the world we live in
52. 52. And these are the hands we're given
53. 53. Use them and let's start trying
54. 54. To make it a place worth fighting for
55. 55. 
56. 56. This is the world we live in
57. 57. And these are the names we're given
58. 58. Stand up and let's start showing
59. 59. Just where our lives are going to
