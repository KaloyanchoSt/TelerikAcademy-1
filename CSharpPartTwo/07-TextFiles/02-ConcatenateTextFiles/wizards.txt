Wizards:

Wizards are renegade spellcasters who use their bodies as vessels for 
arcane energy, forsaking the more careful path favored by other magic 
users. They manipulate all manner of forces to disintegrate, burn, and
freeze their foes, and they can control time and light to teleport, 
create powerful illusions, and deflect oncoming attacks.
