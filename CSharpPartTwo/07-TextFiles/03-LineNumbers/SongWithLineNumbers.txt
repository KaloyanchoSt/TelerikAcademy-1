1. I must have dreamed a thousand dreams
2. Been haunted by a million screams
3. But I can hear the marching feet
4. They're moving into the street
5. 
6. Now, did you read the news today?
7. They say the danger has gone away
8. But I can see the fire's still alight
9. They're burning into the night
10. 
11. There's too many men, too many people
12. Making too many problems
13. And there's not much love to go around
14. Can't you see this is a land of confusion?
15. 
16. This is the world we live in
17. And these are the hands we're given
18. Use them and let's start trying
19. To make it a place worth living in
20. 
21. Oh, superman, where are you now?
22. When everything's gone wrong somehow?
23. The men of steel, these men of power
24. Are losing control by the hour
25. 
26. This is the time, this is the place
27. So we look for the future
28. But there's not much love to go around
29. Tell me why this is a land of confusion
30. 
31. This is the world we live in
32. And these are the hands we're given
33. Use them and let's start trying
34. To make it a place worth living in
35. 
36. I remember long ago
37. When the sun was shining
38. And all the stars were bright all through the night
39. In the wake of this madness, as I held you tight
40. So long ago
41. 
42. I won't be coming home tonight
43. My generation will put it right
44. We're not just making promises
45. That we know we'll never keep
46. 
47. There's too many men, too many people
48. Making too many problems
49. And there's not much love to go round
50. Can't you see this is a land of confusion?
51. 
52. Now, this is the world we live in
53. And these are the hands we're given
54. Use them and let's start trying
55. To make it a place worth fighting for
56. 
57. This is the world we live in
58. And these are the names we're given
59. Stand up and let's start showing
60. Just where our lives are going to
