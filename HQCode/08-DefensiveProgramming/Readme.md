## Defensive Programming and Exceptions

For the exercises use the Visual Studio solution "[homework.zip](https://github.com/flextry/Telerik-Academy/blob/master/Programming%20with%20C%23/4.%20C%23%20High-Quality%20Code/08.%20Defensive%20Programming%2C%20Assertions%20and%20Exceptions/Assertions-and-Exceptions-Homework.zip)".

1. Add `assertions` in the code from the project **"Assertions-Homework"** to ensure all possible preconditions and postconditions are checked.
* Add `exception handling` (where missing) and refactor all incorrect error handling in the code from the **"Exceptions-Homework"** project to follow the best practices for using exceptions.
