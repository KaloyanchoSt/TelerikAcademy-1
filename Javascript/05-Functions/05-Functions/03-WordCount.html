The rage that fills true barbarians cannot be extinguished so long as they live. Fury, a resource that represents pure anger and battle-lust, powers their every terrifying strike.
Fury rises in barbarians as they are damaged, and when they draw their enemies’ blood. As barbarians suffer increasing damage from their enemies (and quickly cut them down in response) their Fury builds to a peak.
Excess Fury can be put to explosive use – barbarians can smash and destroy the battlefield, hurl themselves through the air, and split their opponents in two.
Outside of combat, Fury wanes quickly, so adept Barbarians charge from battle to battle to ensure that they can continually deliver devastating attacks.

MELEE MASTERY
Barbarians casually swing weapons that ordinary warriors can barely lift. They’re able to fight with a full-sized blade, hammer, or axe gripped in each fist, or with enormous (but ponderous) great weapons that crush their enemies into paste.
BRUTAL ATTACKS
Strength and anger go well together. When they lend plenty of Fury to their strikes, barbarians can send their foes flying, shear their limbs off, or knock their bones free of their flesh.
SHOUTS
Barbarians are mighty presences on the battlefield, and their ferocious war cries can bring out battle frenzy in their allies or send their tiny foes fleeing in terror. Even mighty foes who hear a barbarian’s shout can become too shaken to land their most deadly blows.
TAKING HITS
No other heroes can shrug off enemy attacks the way that barbarians do. Their massive strength allows them to equip heavy shields, and their flesh deflects oncoming blades and teeth like metal armor.</textarea></td>
