Database Systems – Overview

1. What database models do you know?
    - Hierarchical (tre)
    - Network / graph
    - Relational (table)
    - Object-oriented

2. Which are the main functions performed by a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)?
    - Create tables, users, database structure and more.
    - Read the stored data ( SELECT )
    - Support for the SQL language
    - Transaction management (optional)

3. Define what is "table" in database terms.
    - Table is grid-like structure that stores the actual data. It is sepparated by columns and rows.

4. Explain the difference between a primary and a foreign key.
    - the primary key is used as indentifier for the row item.
    - the foreign key is used to make the correlation between two tables

5. Explain the different kinds of relationships between tables in relational databases.
    - One-to-many – it represents a single record in the first table has many
        coresponding records in the second table and it’s used very often.
    - Many-to-many – A single record in the first table has many coresponding
        records in the second table and A single record in the first table has many
        coresponding records in the second table.
    - One-to-one – A single record in the first table has many coresponding
        records in the second table and it’s used to model inheritance betwen tables.

6. When is a certain database schema normalized? What are the advantages of normalized databases?
    - Normalized database is database that is cleared from repeating information:
        Eg: "city" in students table -> can be stored as cityID instead of actual city name;
    - Normalized databases are faster and smaller than non-normalized one.

7. What are database integrity constraints and when are they used?
    - Integrity constraints ensure data integrity in the database tables.

8. Point out the pros and cons of using indexes in a database.
    - Pro – quick search operations.
    - Con – slow add and remove operations.

9. What's the main purpose of the SQL language?
    - Manipulation of relational database. CRUD operations: Create, Update, Delete

10. What are transactions used for? Give an example.
    - Transactions are used to make possible for us to make multiple SQL Queries at once.
        That enshures that the SQL Querie will be executed or not-executed. There is no middle situation.
    - Example: Bank account user wants to withdraw some money from his account. The check if the money exists and the actual update for the account
    are executed at the same time. This way there cannot be errors, when other user tries to do the same at the exact same time.

11. What is a NoSQL database?
    - A NoSQL database, uses document-based model (non-relational) and is schema-fre document storage.

12. Explain the clasical non-relational data models.
    - Document model – set of documents, e.g. JSON strings
    - Key-value model – set of key-value pairs
    - Hierarchical key-value – hierarchy of key-value pairs
    - Wide-column model – key-value model with schema
    - Object model – set of OOP-style objects

13. Give few examples of NoSQL databases and their pros and cons.
    a. The pros and cons form most of the NoSQL DBs are the folowing:
    i. Pros:
        1. It's Open Source.
        2. Elastic Scaling.
        3. It’s in the cloud!
    ii. Cons:
        1. It's Open Source.3
        2. Not mature enough for enterprise. 3. A bit new witch leads to lack of expertise and resources. 4. Compatibilty Isues. b. And some examples:
            i. Redis
            i. MongoDB
            i. CouchDB
            iv. Casandra
