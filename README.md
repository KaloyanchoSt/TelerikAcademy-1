============

In this repo you can find all my homeworks, team projects, exams and side projects from my training at TelerikAcademy.

In Telerik Academy we have learned several topics and programming languages like: C#, JavaScript, SQL, PHP and Other. Here is the list of the student program:

1. [C# Part One](/CSharpPartOne/)
------------
> This was the first course in the academy and from todays perspective may look very elementary and easy, but back then it was hard for me because it was full with new information. The course include topics like:
> 
> 1. Introduction to Programming
> 2. Promitive data types and variables

2. [C# Part Two](/CSharpPartTwo/)
------------
